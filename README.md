Paste As File
===========

###Desktop Application to Paste Clipboard Contents into Files

----------------

+ Forked the code from EslaMx7/PasteIntoFiles
+ Removed extraneous information, added ability to use the keyboard
+ Basically streamlined for the purpose of my use case: integration with [Remote Messages](http://www.remotemessages.com).

+ Supports  Any type of Text, Source Code , Images.
+ Change the current saving location or type it yourself.
+ Shortcut in Context Menu (Right Click)
+ to `Unregister` the application and remove the Context Menu Shortcut from your system run the command line as Administrator and run the application with this argument : **`/unreg`**
+ to manually `Register` it use this argument : **`/reg`**
